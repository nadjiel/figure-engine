<h1 align="center">Figure Engine</h1>
<p align="center">A typescript open source 2D game engine for HTML5 games.</p>

This engine is a project that seeks to provide a simple way to start making 2D games in the Web environment using TypeScript/ JavaScript and HTML5.

The project is still in pre-release development and is not completely ready for use but its main purpose is to supply simplicity for starter game devs to learn about game development and start developing quickly with a robust documentation and tutorials to learn from while also making a nice environment to build quick prototypes or simple 2D games.

The development of this project started in 2024 as my thesis for a System Analysis and Development graduation, being an idea that I had in mind for quite some time.

The Figure Engine seeks to provide as its core only the basic features necessary for game development: things like importing resources, iterating the game frames, setting up the game display and such.
That is aimmed to keep it simple and beginner friendly, but if you wish to build upon it feel free to do so, since it is an open source project.

One of the ideas of this engine is being typescript first, since that language delivers lots of Object Oriented programming features and typing functionalities, which are awesome features to use when making games.

## Installing
Since the engine is published to NPM, it should be quite easy to install if you have that package manager with the command:

```
npm install --save-dev figure-engine
```

> Obs: you will most likely install it as a dev dependency since it is used only to develop and build your game, but needs to be bundled in order to run on a browser.

As said in the blockquote, to run on the browser, your project will have to be bundled and to simplify that set up a utility to create a Figure Engine project is also planned to release.

## How to use
A documentation for this engine is still in development.

## Contributing
Contributing to this project isn't available yet as from its pre-release, but I plan to allow it once an official release is launched.
